## Integer encoding -- not supported for modules at the moment.
GETDEL propagate as DEL command to replica
GETEX without argument does not propagate to replica
SETBIT against integer-encoded key
GETBIT against integer-encoded key
SETRANGE against integer-encoded key
## Blocking commands -- not supported
BLPOP, LPUSH + DEL should not awake blocked client
BLPOP, LPUSH + DEL + SET should not awake blocked client
BLPOP with same key multiple times should work
BLPOP with same key multiple times should work (issue #801)
MULTI/EXEC is isolated from the point of view of BLPOP
